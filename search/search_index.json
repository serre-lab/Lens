Once these concepts are obtained, they are just vectors in the latent space v, and it is possible to obtain a  feature visualization - an image that maximise this direction x^* = arg\\ max\\ \\langle g(x), v \\rangle - of these  vectors using MACO, with f(x) = (c \\cdot g)(x).  Finally, since the decomposition is performed on the last layer, there is a linear relationship between the concept embedding and the model's decision. More details on the estimation of importance can be found in the Holistic article.

Moreover, we can also compute an importance vector \\varphi(u), this vector  has a scalar value per concept, representing how crucial a concept was for the classification.  Based on these vectors, we perform UMAP to obtain the clustering graph.  Then, colors are assigned to each point based on its most important concept, the arg\\ max\\ \\varphi(u).  If a concept is the most important for at least 10 times, it is considered important and will be colored.  Finally, the global importance is the average of the logit scores contributed by the concepts across all points.
