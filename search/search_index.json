Each class in ImageNet has its dedicated page where you can see the concepts the model uses to classify that class.  For each concept, a normalized importance level is assigned, indicating how crucial the concept is for the class. For instance, an importance level of 0.30 means that a concept contributes to 30% of the sum of logits for all points classified as such.  The \"Getting Started\" page serves as an introduction, explaining how to interpret the results.</p>"},{"location":"#contributors","title":"Contributors","text":"<p>The dataset and the website itself were developed by Thomas Fel.
